Most events work the same as any other svelte application. Theres the DOM events you know from
HTML, some Svelte [component props](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/basic-markup#Component-props)
but also raycasting which is specific to 3D applications.

## DOM events

The [`useThrelte`](/reference/core/hooks/use-threlte/) hook provides you with
direct access to Threltes wrapper div called the `dom`. The `canvas` element is
also available if needed.

## Prop events

The `<T>` component has it's own [events](/reference/core/components/t#events). It can even pick up
on events coming from the [underlying Three.js objects](/reference/core/components/t#object-events).

## Raycasting events

Casting rays may end up being a big part of your 3D application. They're
required for creating [`interactivity`](/reference/extras/interaction/interactivity)
(click, pointer, mouseover etc...) on your scene's meshes.

Raycasting can become expensive on complex shapes or if you have a high number
of objects. This can be mitigated by either:

- Raycasting against a simplier, invisible object (as is done by [mesh bounds](/reference/extras/performance/mesh-bounds)).
- And/or introducing a better raycasting algorithm such as Bounding Volume Hirerchies ([BVH](/reference/extras/interaction/bvh/)).

For simple use cases, Three.js's default raycaster works well.
