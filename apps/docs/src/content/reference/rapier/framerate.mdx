Threlte's `<World>` component has a `framerate` prop that can be used to control
the framerate of the physics simulation.

## About JavaScript Timing

By default, the physics framerate is set to vary depending on the time delta
passed as the argument to the callback of `requestAnimationFrame`. Take this
trivial example:

```ts
const render = (delta: number) => {
  console.log(delta)
  requestAnimationFrame(render)
}
requestAnimationFrame(render)
```

Unlucky for us, the time delta passed to the callback of `requestAnimationFrame`
is not the same for each frame and varies depending on several factors such as
the refresh rate of the monitor and the general load of your computer or
application. When using a `varying` framerate, this time delta is used to
_advance the physics simulation_. This implies that realistically no two
executions of the same physics simulation will yield the same result. In short:
it's **not deterministic**.

For most cases, this is still the best choice since it doesn't require you to
think about the aspects of handling different framerates for rendering and
physics.

Sometimes however, if you're developing a game or if you wish to have more
controls art directing the outcome, you want a physics simulation to **always
yield the same result**, e.g. to be **deterministic**. In this case, you can set the
`framerate` prop to a fixed number. A fixed framerate of `50` for example will
_step_ the physics simulation 50 times per second with a delta of exactly `1 /
50 = 0.02` seconds. The following example illustrates the difference:
