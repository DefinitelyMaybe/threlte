This is a port of [drei's `<View/>` component](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/portals/view). It is used to display multiple scenes using only one canvas. Our implemenation re-uses parts of the main canvas's context but creates new camera, scene, parent and DOM contexts. This ensures you can use threlte's other components as per normal.

The following example is equivelant to three.js's [multiple elements example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_multiple_elements).

<Example path="extras/view" />

Under the hood, this component uses the renderer's [scissor-cut method](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.setScissor). [Three.js has documentation](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/multiple-scenes) for when using scissor-cuts as the styling of your canvas has different effects on the renderering. You access the canvas to switch between the options via the `useCanvas` hook.
