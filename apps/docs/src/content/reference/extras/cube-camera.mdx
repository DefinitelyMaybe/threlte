A wrapper around three's [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera) that exposes a `renderTarget` prop. Chidren are made invisible so that they are not included in the render.

<Example path="extras/cube-camera" />

## Render Target

The entire render target that is used by the underlying cube camera is available through the `renderTarget` snippet prop. Usually you'll only want to use the `renderTarget.texture`.

```svelte
<CubeCamera>
  {#snippet children({ renderTarget })}
    <T.Mesh>
      <T.SphereGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial envMap={renderTarget.texture} />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

## Scene Props

`<CubeCamera>` accepts a `background` prop that can be used to set the background of the scene when rendering to the texture. By default the background that is `scene.background`. `background` can be any valid [Scene.background](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.background).

```svelte
<script>
  const background = new Color(0xff_00_ff)
</script>

<CubeCamera {background}>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

The `fog` prop is used the same way and accepts any valid [scene.fog](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.fog). By default `scene.fog` is used.

These "scene" props are only used when rendering the scene to the underlying render target. After rendering to the target, the original scene props are restored.

## Controlling Frames

The scene is rendered to the render target every frame. This is sometimes unnecessary especially if you have a static scene. You can use the `frames` prop to control how many times the scene should be rendered.
