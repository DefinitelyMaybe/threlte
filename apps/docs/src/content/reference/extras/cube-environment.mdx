`<CubeEnvironment>` is almost exactly like \<Enviroment> but it has a few key differences, namely that its used to load and assign `THREE.CubeTexture`s to `scene.environment`. Other differences will be listed below. For all other information please refer to the [\<Environment>](/docs/reference/extras/environment) documentation.

<Example path="extras/cube-environment/basic" />

## URLs

`<CubeEnvironment>`'s `urls` prop is a six-tuple of textures that comprise a cube texture. The first file's extension decides which loader to use to load the files. Refer to the table below to determine which loader is used for each extension. The order of the `urls` is important. The order is `[positiveX, negativeX, positiveY, negativeY, positiveZ, negativeZ]`.

| extension  | loader                                                                                                                  |

## No Default Load Options

`<CubeEnvironment>` does not have a default load options because it doesn't need to do anything with the `CubeTexture` once it has been created. You can still pass in `loadOptions` if you want to modify the texture before it is assigned to `scene.environment`.
