`<CubeEnvironment>` is almost exactly like \<Enviroment> but it has a few key differences. Those differences will be noted here. For all other documentation please refer to the docs for [\<Environment>](/docs/reference/extras/environment).

<Example path="extras/cube-environment/basic" />

## Resources

`<CubeEnvironment>`'s `resources` prop can either be a six-tuple of strings to files or a single `CubeTexture` instance. If it is not an instance, the files will be loaded. The loader is determined by the first file's extension. Refer to the table below to determine which loader is used for a particular file extension.

| file extension | loader                                                                                                                  |
