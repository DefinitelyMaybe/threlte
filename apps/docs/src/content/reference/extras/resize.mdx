Scales down a group of objects by the maximum dimension of their bounding box. Object proportions are preserved. This is particular useful if you want to "normalize" the dimensions of an object to be in the range 0 to 1.

<Example path="extras/resize/two-boxes" />

In the scene above, one box has been created with the default dimensions of 1, 1, 1. The other was created with width, height, and depth all equal and greater than 1 but it has been resized to match the dimensions of the first box.

## Choosing the Dimension

You can choose the dimension by providing the `dimension` prop, otherwise the maximum dimension is used. The `dimension` prop can be one of three values. A value of `width` corresponds to the x-axis. A value of `height` corresponds to the y-axis. A value of `depth` corresponds to the z-axis.

```svelte
<Resize dimension="height">
  <T.Mesh />
</Resize>
```

<Tip type="warning">
  If you use the `dimension` prop, the dimensions will not be normalized to the range 0 to 1 unless
  the maximum dimension is chosen.
</Tip>

## Bring Your Own Box

Use the `box` prop to provide your own Box3 instance. Doing so allows you to capture the bounding box of the objects prior to any scaling

```svelte
<script>
  import { Box3 } from 'three'
  const box = new Box3()
</script>

<Resize {box}>
  <T.Mesh />
</Resize>

<T.Box3Helper args={[box]} />
```

## Normalizing Multiple Objects

If you have a bunch of source objects that are all different sizes, a useful technique is to wrap each one in a `<Resize>`. Once they've all been normalized, it may be easier to think about the relative sizes.
