<Example path="extras/resize/plugin-test" />

Scales up or down a group of objects by the maximum dimension of their bounding box. Object proportions are preserved. This is particularly useful if you want to "normalize" the dimensions of an object to be in the range 0 to 1.

<Example path="extras/resize/multiple-objects" />

In the example above, objects of various source sizes are resized so that they're more or less within the same range. If you check off _resize_, you can see that the fox is so large that the camera has to pull back just to see it. Likewise, the flower is so small that it's hard to find it in the scene.

## Choosing the Axis

You can choose the axis by providing the `axis` prop, otherwise the maximum axis is used.

```svelte
<Resize axis="x">
  <T.Mesh />
</Resize>
```

<Tip type="warning">
  If you use the `axis` prop, the dimensions will not be normalized to the range 0 to 1 unless the
  maximum axis is chosen.
</Tip>

## Bring Your Own Box

Use the `box` prop to provide your own Box3 instance. Doing so allows you to capture the bounding box of the objects prior to any scaling

```svelte
<script>
  import { Box3 } from 'three'
  const box = new Box3()
</script>

<Resize {box}>
  <T.Mesh />
</Resize>

<T.Box3Helper args={[box]} />
```

## Normalizing Multiple Objects

If you have a bunch of source objects that are all different sizes, a useful technique is to wrap each one in a `<Resize>`. Once they've all been normalized, it may be easier to think about their relative sizes.
