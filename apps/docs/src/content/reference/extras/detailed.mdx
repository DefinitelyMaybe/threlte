`<Detailed>` is a wrapper around ThreeJS's LOD component. A common technique to improve performance is to swap out high-detail models or meshes for low-detail ones at large distances.

<Example path="extras/detailed" />

Notice how as the mesh's distance from the camera increases, a mesh with less vertices is renderered.

<Tip type="tip">
It is fairly common to export a high-detail, medium-detail, and low-detail model from 3D asset creation tools.
