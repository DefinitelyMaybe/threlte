`<Detailed>` is a wrapper around ThreeJS's [LOD](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/LOD). A common technique to improve performance is to swap out high-detail models or meshes for low-detail ones at large distances.

<Example path="extras/detailed" />

Notice how as the mesh's distance from the camera increases, a mesh with less vertices is renderered.

<Tip type="tip">
  It is fairly common to export a high-detail, medium-detail, and low-detail model from 3D asset
  creation tools.
</Tip>

Children of `<Detailed>` can be passed a `distance` prop which dictates at what distance the child should be visible and others should not. `distance` defaults to 0 if it is not provided.

```svelte
<Detailed>
  <T.Mesh>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
  <T.Mesh distance={10}>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
</Detailed>
```

Children of `<Detailed>` can be passed a `hysteresis` prop which is used to avoid flickering at LOD boundaries. `hysteresis` defaults to 0 if it is not provided.

```svelte
<Detailed>
  <T.Mesh hysteresis={0.5}>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
</Detailed>
```
