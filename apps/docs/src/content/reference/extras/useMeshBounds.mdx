A raycast function that will first check for collision with the object's bounding sphere, then it will check against the object's bounding box but **only** if the bounding box has been previously computed. You can use this function if you want to trade pointer precision for an increase in performance.

## Usage

`useMeshBounds` returns a function that you can pass to an object's [`raycast`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=mesh#api/en/objects/Mesh.raycast) prop.

```svelte
<script>
  import { useMeshBounds } from '@threlte/extras'

  const meshBounds = useMeshBounds()
</script>

<T.Mesh raycast={meshBounds}>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
</T.Mesh>
```

<Tip type="tip">
  If your meshes or models aren't very complex in terms of geometry, `useMeshBounds` won't provide
  much of a performance boost.
