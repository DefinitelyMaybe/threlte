A cheap [CanvasTexture](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=canvastexture#api/en/textures/CanvasTexture)-based mesh meant to look like a shadow without the need for any lights in the scene.

<Example path="extras/shadow" />

## Rotation

ThreeJS uses a y-up coordinate system. This means that the z-axis is into and out of the screen.

`<Shadow>`'s geometry is not rotated. It exists in the xy-plane just like if you created a mesh with a plane geometry. If you want the shadow to appear flat on the ground (in the xz-plane), you may need to rotate it.

```svelte
<!-- rotate the shadow to be in the xz-plane. -->
<Shadow rotation.x={-1 * 0.5 * Math.PI} />
```

`<Shadow>`'s material is double-sided so no matter its rotation, it will always be visible.

## Avoiding Z-fighting

You may need to offset the shadow by a small amount to avoid z-fighting.

```svelte
<Shadow position.z={0.01} />
```

## Transparency

Because the canvas texture uses an alpha channel, `<Shadow>`'s material uses transparency. This means it will be sorted into a "transparent objects" render list by the renderer. In three.js, transparent objects are renderer _after_ opaque objects. This may be something to keep in mind when using `<Shadow>`.
