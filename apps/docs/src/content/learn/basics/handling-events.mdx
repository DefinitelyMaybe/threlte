Events come in three different flavours in Threlte. The DOM events you know from
HTML, some svelte [component props](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/basic-markup#Component-props)
and raycasting.

## DOM events

To get started, you'll need an HTML element. The [`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte)
hook provides you with direct access to Threltes HTML div wrapper - the `dom`.
The `canvas` is also available if that is more appropriate for your events.

## Prop events

The `<T>` component has it's own [events](/docs/reference/core/t#events). It can even pickup
on events coming from the [underlying three.js objects](/docs/reference/core/t#object-events).

## Raycasting events

Casting rays can end up being a big part of your 3D application. They're required for
creating [`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity) (click, pointer
and wheel events) on your scene's meshes. Raycasting can struggle with complex shapes
or a high number of objects but this can be mitigated by either:

- Raycasting against an simplier, invisible object ([a sphere](/docs/reference/extras/mesh-bounds) for example)
- Or introducing a better raycasting algorithm such as Bounding Volume Hirerchies ([BVH](/docs/learn/advanced/plugins#bvh-raycast-plugin))

In general, Three.js's default raycaster works well enough.
