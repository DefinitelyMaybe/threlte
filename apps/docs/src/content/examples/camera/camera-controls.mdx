You may have come up against limitations with Three.js's `<OrbitalControls/>`.
[Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is an alternative
which supports smooth transitions and a variety of features.

<Example path="camera/camera-controls" />

The `CameraControls` class in the example _extends_ the camera controls library's
`CameraControls` class.

It automatically installs `camera-controls` if not already installed and connects to the dom element that is passed into its constructor.

## `<CameraControls>` component

Updating the controls happens in a task in the `<CameraControls>` component.

When the component unmounts, the controls are disposed of.

You could put both of these actions in the constructor of the `CameraControls` class if you didn't want to make a component out of it but be careful using threlte's [`useTask`](/docs/reference/core/use-task) since it accesses context set up by the [`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) component.

<Tip type="info">
  The camera-controls package features include first-person, third-person, pointer-lock,
  fit-to-bounding-sphere and much more!

### Prevent SSR Externalization

If you are using SvelteKit or Vite for building your app, you may need to externalize the `camera-controls` library.

To externalize the `camera-controls` library put the following in your `vite-config.js` or `vite-config.ts`.

```typescript {4-6}+
// vite-config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit()],
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['camera-controls']
  }
})
```
