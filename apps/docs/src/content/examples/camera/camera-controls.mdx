You may have come up against limitations with Three.js's `<OrbitalControls/>`.
[Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is an alternative
which supports smooth transitions and a variety of features.

Thes example below demonstrates how to incorporate the camera controls library
into threlte.

<Example path="camera/camera-controls" />

The only difference between the class in the example and the export from the
camera controls library is that the example's `CameraControls` will
automatically connect and disconnect to the dom element that is sent into its
constructor. Although you can update the control's camera in the same way, it
won't work as intended because there's a lot of setup involved in the
constructor. It is possible but in order to do it you'd have to create a new
CameraControls instance if you wanted to be sure that anytime the camera
changed, the controls were updated to match.

  The camera-controls package features include first-person, third-person, pointer-lock,
  fit-to-bounding-sphere and much more!
