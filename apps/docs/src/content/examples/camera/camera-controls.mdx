You may have come up against limitations with Three.js's `<OrbitalControls/>`.
[Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is an alternative
which supports smooth transitions and a variety of features.

Thes example below demonstrates how to incorporate the camera controls library
into threlte.

<Example path="camera/camera-controls" />

The `CameraControls` class in the example _extends_ the camera controls library's
`CameraControls` class.

It automatically installs `camera-controls` if not already installed, connects
and disconnects to the dom element that is sent into its constructor, updates
the controls and potentially invalidates the scene and cleans up after itself
when the component it is instantiated in is destroyed.

<Tip type="info">
  The camera-controls package features include first-person, third-person, pointer-lock,
  fit-to-bounding-sphere and much more!
