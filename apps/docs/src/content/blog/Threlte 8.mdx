Today we are releasing **Threlte 8**, a complete rewrite
that marks a leap forward in performance, flexibility, and developer experience.
This release has been cooking for the last 6 months. We're super excited about
the potential it unlocks for next chapter of 3D graphics on the web.

## Why rewrite Threlte?

It's our migration to **Svelte 5**. The new features of the language
are groundbreaking for us as developers and embracing it was also an opportunity
to refine the existing APIs. Furthermore, a lot has been happening within the world of **three.js**.
We've carved the path for threlte to take advantage of those developments too.

## What's new in Threlte 8?

Threlte 8 is packed with enhancements in `@threlte/core` and updates in all our other packages.
Here are the highlights:

### All-new `<T>` component

The universal [`<T>` component](/docs/reference/core/t) has been **reduced in
complexity** all while **adding features and flexibility** that were just not
possible before.

- Props are now evaluated individually
- [`attach` got a lot more
  powerful](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#attach-api--trait-components)
- [Automatic disposal is more
  transparent](docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#automatic-disposal) and
- [Events have been algined with svelte 5](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#events)

### New `@threlte/extras` components

We've added a lot of new things to play around with in `@threlte/extras` including:
[`<AsciiRenderer>`](/docs/reference/extras/ascii-renderer),
[`<CubeCamera>`](/docs/reference/extras/cube-camera),
[`<MeshDiscardMaterial>`](/docs/reference/extras/discard-material),
[`<RadialGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/radial-gradient-texture),
[`<LinearGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/linear-gradient-texture),
[`useViewport`](/docs/reference/extras/use-viewport),
[`<HUD>`](/docs/reference/extras/hud),
[`<Resize>`](/docs/reference/extras/resize),
[`<meshBounds>`](/docs/reference/extras/mesh-bounds) and
[`<Detailed>`](/docs/reference/extras/detailed); with more to come ðŸ˜‡

### Custom type support for `<T>`

Plugins such as
[`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity#prop-types) now expose
types which can be added to your ambient type definitions for the `<T>`
component to pick up. Event handlers and custom `<T>` component objects are now
type-safe.

### Fixed frame physics

`@threlte/rapier` now supports [fixed frame
physics](/docs/reference/rapier/framerate) letting you craft simulations with
predictability and consistency.

### Threlte plugin API

The **Plugin API** got an update to [fully embrace Svelte 5's reactivity
model](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#plugin-api). The doc page also
had an update to better introduce the API's capabilities.

### This is the _WebGPU_ way

Threlte 8 introduces a clear path for using WebGPU. Threlte requires minimal
changes to projects in order to start using three.js's new [WebGPU renderer](/docs/examples/renderers/webgpurenderer).
Documentation is also in the works for using three's new shading language - [TSL](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language).

### A new package appears

The studio package will be part of this release however it is still in a very
early alpha stage. This means your mileage will vary. We have to nail down the
remaining issues but once we do, we'll create another post to properly introduce
the studio to the communitty.

## How to migrate to Threlte 8

There are breaking changes. Threlte 8 is not backward-compatible but we've
tried our best to cover the details within our [migration
guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#threlte-8). For further help,
reach out to us on discord.

## Built with the community, for the community

This rewrite was a team effort with great contributions from the community.
Thank you to everyone who tested out any of our `@next` releases. We're immensely
grateful for the time, talent, and passion of our community. You guys rock ðŸ˜ƒ

## What's next?

We'd love to hear about what everyone makes with Threlte 8! Take it for a spin,
explore the new documentation, and start building your next 3D application with
the super powers of Threlte 8 ðŸŽ‰
