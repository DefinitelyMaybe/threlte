Today we are releasing **Threlte 8**, a complete rewrite
that marks a leap forward in performance, flexibility, and developer experience.

## Why Rewrite Threlte?

The release of **Svelte 5** introduces a groundbreaking feature:
[Runes](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes). These compiler
instructions unlock the power of **signals** – a paradigm shift for reactive
programming in Svelte. Svelte 5 waves goodbye to existing features such as event
handlers and slots; they're replaced with callbacks and
[Snippets](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/snippet).

Embracing Svelte 5 meant rethinking a lot of the existing Threlte APIs from the
ground up to fully leverage Svelte's new capabilities.

## What’s New in Threlte 8?

<Tip type="info">
  If you want to jump straight into the new Threlte, check out the [migration
  guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#threlte-8).
</Tip>

Threlte 8 is packed with enhancements in `@threlte/core` and other packages.
Here are the highlights:

### **All-new `<T>` component**

The universal [`<T>` component](/docs/reference/core/t) has been **reduced in
complexity** all while **adding features and flexibility** that were just not
possible before. Props are now evaluated individually, [`attach` got a lot more
powerful](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#attach-api--trait-components),
[automatic disposal is more
transparent](docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#automatic-disposal) and
[events work entirely
differently](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#events).

### **A lot of new `@threlte/extras`**

We've added a lot of new things to play around with to `@threlte/extras`, here
are some highlights to check out:
[`<AsciiRenderer>`](/docs/reference/extras/ascii-renderer),
[`<CubeCamera>`](/docs/reference/extras/cube-camera),
[`<MeshDiscardMaterial>`](/docs/reference/extras/discard-material),
[`<RadialGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/radial-gradient-texture),
[`<LinearGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/linear-gradient-texture),
[`useViewport`](/docs/reference/extras/use-viewport),
[`<HUD>`](/docs/reference/extras/hud),
[`<Resize>`](/docs/reference/extras/resize),
[`<meshBounds>`](/docs/reference/extras/mesh-bounds) and
[`<Detailed>`](/docs/reference/extras/detailed).

### **Threlte Plugin API**

The **Plugin API** got an update to [fully embrace Svelte 5's reactivity
model](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#plugin-api).

### **Custom Type Support for `<T>`**

Plugins such as
[`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity#prop-types) now expose
types which can be added to your ambient type definitions for the `<T>`
component to pick up. Event handlers and custom `<T>` component objects are now
type-safe.

### **Fixed Frame Physics**

`@threlte/rapier` now supports [fixed frame
physics](/docs/reference/rapier/framerate) letting you craft simulations with
confidence and predictability.

### Under the Hood

Not only `@threlte/core` received major updates. Every other package had to be
updated to Svelte 5. Svelte now also provides better type support out of the box
which means we can finally skip hand-writing types for components and rely on
the Svelte compiler to do its magic.

## A Fresh Start: Migration to Threlte 8

Breaking changes can be daunting. While Threlte 8 is not backward-compatible, we
provide a comprehensive [migration
guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#threlte-8)
to help you transition smoothly.

## Built with the Community, for the Community

This rewrite wasn’t a solo endeavor. It took six months and the contributions of
a dedicated community of developers to bring Threlte 8 to life. We’re immensely
grateful for the time, talent, and passion that went into this.

## What’s Next?

```bash
npm install @threlte/core
