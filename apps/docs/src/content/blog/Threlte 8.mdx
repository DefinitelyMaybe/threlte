Today we are releasing **Threlte 8**, a complete rewrite
that marks a leap forward in performance, flexibility, and developer experience.
This release has been cooking for the last 6 months. We're super excited about
the potential it unlocks for next chapter of 3D graphics on the web.

## Why Rewrite Threlte?

It's our natural migration to **Svelte 5**. The new features of the language
are groundbreaking for us as developers and embracing it was an opportunity for us
to refine a lot of the existing APIs. A lot has also been happening within **three.js**
and we've used this migration as an opportunity to position threlte to take
advantage of those developments too.

## What's New in Threlte 8?

Threlte 8 is packed with enhancements in `@threlte/core` and updates in all our other packages.
Here are the highlights:

### All-new `<T>` component

The universal [`<T>` component](/docs/reference/core/t) has been **reduced in
complexity** all while **adding features and flexibility** that were just not
possible before.

- Props are now evaluated individually
- [`attach` got a lot more
  powerful](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#attach-api--trait-components)
- [Automatic disposal is more
  transparent](docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#automatic-disposal) and
- [Events have been reworked inline with svelte 5](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#events)

### New `@threlte/extras` components

We've added a lot of new things to play around with in `@threlte/extras` including:
[`<AsciiRenderer>`](/docs/reference/extras/ascii-renderer),
[`<CubeCamera>`](/docs/reference/extras/cube-camera),
[`<MeshDiscardMaterial>`](/docs/reference/extras/discard-material),
[`<RadialGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/radial-gradient-texture),
[`<LinearGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/linear-gradient-texture),
[`useViewport`](/docs/reference/extras/use-viewport),
[`<HUD>`](/docs/reference/extras/hud),
[`<Resize>`](/docs/reference/extras/resize),
[`<meshBounds>`](/docs/reference/extras/mesh-bounds) and
[`<Detailed>`](/docs/reference/extras/detailed); with more to come.

### Custom Type Support for `<T>`

Plugins such as
[`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity#prop-types) now expose
types which can be added to your ambient type definitions for the `<T>`
component to pick up. Event handlers and custom `<T>` component objects are now
type-safe.

### Fixed Frame Physics

`@threlte/rapier` now supports [fixed frame
physics](/docs/reference/rapier/framerate) letting you craft simulations with
predictability and consistency.

### Threlte Plugin API

The **Plugin API** got an update to [fully embrace Svelte 5's reactivity
model](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#plugin-api). The doc page also
had an update to better introduce the API's capabilities.

### This is the _WebGPU_ Way

Threlte 8 introduces a clear path for using three.js's new
[WebGPU renderer](/docs/examples/renderers/webgpurenderer). Additionally, we're looking
forward to seeing the use of three's new shading language - [TSL](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language).
It's a significant improvement upon the previous method of tinkering with `.onBeforeCompile()`

## How to Migrate to Threlte 8

There are breaking changes. Threlte 8 is not backward-compatible but we've
tried our best to cover the details within our [migration
guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#threlte-8). For further help,
reach out to us on discord.

## Built with the Community, for the Community

This rewrite was a team effort with great contributions from the communitty.
Thank you to everyone who tested out any of our `@next` releases. We're immensely
grateful for the time, talent, and passion of our communitty. You guys rock ðŸ˜ƒ

## What's Next?

We'd love for hear about what everyone makes with threlte 8! Take the new
Threlte for a spin, explore the new documentation, and start building your
next 3D application.
