## Auto-imported components

These components can be used in .mdx files without explicitly importing them.

### `<Example>`

The component `<Example>` renders an example that is defined in the `src/examples` folder.

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example path="core/use-frame" />
```

renders as:

{/* <Example path="core/use-frame" /> */}

Hide the code:

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example
  path="core/use-frame"
  hideCode
/>
```

Hide the preview:

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example
  path="core/use-frame"
  hidePreview
/>
```

Expand the code section by default:

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example
  path="core/use-frame"
  expandCode
/>
```

Show a specific file by default:

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example
  path="core/use-frame"
  showFile="directory/file.ts"
/>
```

All `<Example>`'s are iframes by default but this can be changed by setting the iframe prop to false

```mdx title="example.mdx"
<Example
  path="core/use-frame"
  iframe={false}
/>
```
